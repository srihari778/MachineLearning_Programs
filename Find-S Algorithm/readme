## What is FInd-S Algorithm

The find-S algorithm is a basic concept learning algorithm in machine learning. The find-S algorithm finds the most specific hypothesis that fits all the positive examples. We have to note here that the algorithm considers only those positive training example. The find-S algorithm starts with the most specific hypothesis and generalizes this hypothesis each time it fails to classify an observed positive training data. Hence, the Find-S algorithm moves from the most specific hypothesis to the most general hypothesis.

## Important Representation :

-> ? indicates that any value is acceptable for the attribute.
-> specify a single required value ( e.g., Cold ) for the attribute.
-> ϕ indicates that no value is acceptable.
-> The most general hypothesis is represented by: {?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?}
-> The most specific hypothesis is represented by: {ϕ, ϕ, ϕ, ϕ, ϕ, ϕ}

## Steps Involved In Find-S :

-->Start with the most specific hypothesis.
h = {ϕ, ϕ, ϕ, ϕ, ϕ, ϕ}
-->Take the next example and if it is negative, then no changes occur to the hypothesis.
-->If the example is positive and we find that our initial hypothesis is too specific then we update our current hypothesis to a general condition.
-->Keep repeating the above steps till all the training examples are complete.
-->After we have completed all the training examples we will have the final hypothesis when can use to classify the new examples

The total number of training instances are : 4

The initial hypothesis is :
['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']

The hypothesis for the training instance 4 is :
['sunny', 'warm', '?', 'strong', '?', '?']

The Maximally specific hypothesis for the traininginstance is
['sunny', 'warm', '?', 'strong', '?', '?']
